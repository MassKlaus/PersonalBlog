# Software is fun, Let's get good at it

Hi, I am Massine Mouha. I am learning how computers work and I want to dive into embedded systems after a while on the web side of things.

So here I'll be posting about my projects, my thoughts and my learnings.

Currently diving deeper with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), C. And that's why this blog is powered with [Zine](https://zine-ssg.io/)!

Here is my [Github](https://github.com/MassKlaus/)! My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/massine-mouha-a04b53322/)!
