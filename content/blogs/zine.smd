I've recently decided to start cataloging and expressing some of my thoughts in a more digestable way so I've come around to starting this blog site.

I've dabbled with site genrators in the past but they all seemed overkill for what I needed, a simple site where I can categorize things and automatically generate links and turn mds into html with decent styling.

Since I've been watching a lot of zig talks and videos all around, I came across zine. It has it's own superset of Markdown and Html and handles metadata with ziggy so I gave it a try and I am loving it.

This is a snippet of how I generated the links in the home page

```html
<div>
    <h2>Blogs</h2>
    <div class="site-items" :loop="$site.page('blogs').subpages()">
        <a href="$loop.it.link()" :text="$loop.it.title"></a>
        <span class="date">
            At
            <span :text='$loop.it.date.format("01/02/2001")'></span>
        </span>
    </div>
</div>
```

It's a lot more straightforward than I thought it would be and I am excited to see where this goes. But for now, I must resume my fight with css to make this site pretty.
