Syalizer is a music visualizer, the idea was initially inspired by Tsoding's Musializer. 

Following behind his initial idea, this code base Makes use of the `FFT` to generate different sound amplitudes that we perceive as the music plays. 

Using shaders that can be updated and replaced at runtime, Syalizer let's you apply any creative effect you might have on your mind. Be it a rainbow effect, increased line/bar thickness, some bloom, blurring and more.

The main goal was getting comfortable with zig and slowly learning how to handle memory with it properly.

This also supports rendering video through the FFMPEG cli. 

Here is a little preview of the content.

```

The software is not fully done yet as I want to offer more freedom when rendering the output so future updates are still coming.
